  Revisiting “classical homeopathy” through Hahnemann’s original works and Kent’s later interpretations, distinguishing empirical foundations from philosophical overlays.

## Why Revisit?

The phrase *classical homeopathy* is often used carelessly. For some, it refers to Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), the German physician who founded homeopathy. For others, it means the interpretive school of James Tyler Kent (1849–1916), whose *Lectures on Homœopathic Philosophy* shaped American practice in the early 20th century.  

### Hahnemann’s Foundation
- **Empirical basis**: provings documented in *Materia Medica Pura* (1811–1821) and *Chronic Diseases* (1828–1830).  
- **Organon of Medicine**: successive editions (1810–1842) refined the principles, emphasizing observation, experiment, and clinical fidelity.  
- **Miasm theory**: late development, grounded in chronic disease observation rather than speculative metaphysics.  

### Kent’s Overlay
- **Philosophical interpretation**: Swedenborgian metaphysics, vitalism, and moral dimensions.  
- **Pedagogical clarity**: Kent’s *Repertory* (1897) and *Lectures* gave students a practical framework, but often at the cost of historical accuracy.  
- **Problem**: Kent’s terminology sometimes diverges from Hahnemann’s plain German, introducing absolutist or mystical tones absent in the originals.  

### Later Critics & Correctives
- **Richard Hughes (1836–1902)**: urged a return to Hahnemann’s empirical core, warning against “transcendentalist” overlays.  
- **Dudgeon & Hempel**: translators who struggled to keep Hahnemann’s precise medical German intact in English.  
- **Modern reassessment**: highlights the need to distinguish primary sources from interpretive layers.
