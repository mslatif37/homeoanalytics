Analyzing Historical Homeopathic Literature

This programme systematizes classical sources (Kent, Boenninghausen, Hahnemann, Hughes) into clean tables for quantitative study.
We structure symptoms by Location, Sensation/Observation, Timing/Sequence, and Notes/Context to enable CSV/JSON exports and visual analytics.

Methods include regex-first parsers with human-in-the-loop audit, FTS5-backed concordance alignment, and remedyâ€“rubric bipartite graphs
to explore signature strength and co-occurrence.
